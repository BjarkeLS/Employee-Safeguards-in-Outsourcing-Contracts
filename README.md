# Employee Safeguards in Outsourcing Contracts: How Buyers’ Ideology, Fiscal Capacity, and Priority of Price Affect Employee-Related Contract Language
Python notebook for article by Hansen and Lund-Sørensen about employee safeguards in outsourcing contracts.

**Abstract (from the article)**
To reduce the social costs of outsourcing, public buyers could specify contract rules safeguarding outsourced employees. 
We therefore combine literature on outsourced employees and incomplete contracts to investigate whether public buyers safeguard outsourced employees 
and whether employee safeguards differ across public buyers’ ideologies, fiscal capacities, and priority of contract price. 
Based on 26 safeguards developed with practitioners, we use a unique dataset of 115,459 documents from 2014‒2022 
and apply Natural Language Processing to extract safeguards from 247 Danish tenders. 
The analysis finds that public buyers use nine employee safeguards, that safeguards have three dimensions, 
and that public buyers cluster in types that use few, medium, or many safeguards. 
We also show that public buyers with less fiscal capacity and more price orientation have fewer safeguards. 
These results have implications, as public buyers can have different capacities and motives to safeguard employees
and thus potentially decrease the social costs of outsourcing.

**About the notebooks**
We have uploaded two python notebooks. 
In the first part, we construct our data set and perform various forms of manipulation of the text material, including data clearing, word tokenization and lemmatization.
We also identify the tenders where employee transfers applies. In the second part, we identify the different safegaurds 
that the article uses as dependent variables in the analysis.

More information appears in the method section of the article by Hansen and Lund-Sørensen.
The article has not yet been published and this description will be updated with a link to the article when it is published.

Python version 3.8.8 (64-bit)

**Data availability**
Unfortunately, it is not possible to access the data on which the two notebooks are based.
Therefore, it is not possible to reproduce our results. However, we provide these notebooks to be transparent with our approach.
